# Fields configuration

Fields could be configured on multiple levels:

- widget factory configuration;
- common configuration from theme (optional);
- individual configuration from theme (optional);
- configuration at the place of use.

More specific configuration has more priority.

## Widget factory configuration

Widget factory could be used to configure fields. It is handy to use it to set global defaults.
